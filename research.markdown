## Research

#### Diffusion MR Imaging

|**Cellular Automata Tractography** method, which runs on GPU, allows shortest-paths tractography under one second runtime. Furthermore, connectivity based segmentation of the cerebral structures can be performed at the same time, as shown in the figure. [Code and Paper](https://github.com/andachamamci/CATractography) <br> In the **IronTract Challenge**, the accuracy was evaluated by comparison to tracer injections in the same macaque brains as the diffusion data. The accuracy of the proposed method (5th method) was between the deterministic and probabilistic methods.

| ![Image](/img/figals.png) |**Diffusion tensor imaging in early amyotrophic lateral sclerosis** study aimed to perform diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to detect white matter microstructural abnormalities, and also understanding the pathophysiology in Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) using 3T magnetic resonance imaging. DTI showed decreased fractional anisotropy in bilateral corticospinal tracts and internal capsule posterior crus. There was a correlation between the FA reductions in this region and the severity of the disease in the patients with ALS. Consequently, DTI may be useful to monitor the progress and effectiveness of treatment interventions, as well as understanding the pathophysiology of ALS. [Article](/docs/dti-als.pdf)|

#### Functional MRI Applications

**Effects of Menstrual Cycle on Resting State Functional Connectivity in Schizophrenia** study investigates resting state functional connectivity (RS-FC) alterations related to menstrual cycle phase and/or hormone levels in patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls and aims to contribute to the understanding of the effects of ovarian hormones on the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and brain functions.

|In **Working memory dysfunction in delusional disorders**, using an established working memory paradigm with variable levels of memory load, we investigated alterations in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of brain regions in patients with Delusional disorder (DD). Our findings were in line with the findings of the early reports on deficient functioning in temporal or limbic regions of the brain. Further, patients with DD displayed prefrontal dysfunction as seen in patients with schizophrenia.

**Functional MRI in Determining Language Lateralization** aims to noninvasively measure the laterality of language functions in the brain for the presurgical evaluation of epileptic patients. Questions for the word production task were projected to a screen and were seen by the patient through a mirror centered above the subjects eyes. The results of this f-MRI study have shown that a word generation task is reliable for determining the hemispheric language dominance.
