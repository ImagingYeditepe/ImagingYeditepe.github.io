## Research

#### Diffusion MR Fiber Tractography

|**Cellular Automata Tractography** method, which is implemented on GPU, allows shortest-paths tractography under one second runtime. Furthermore, connectivity based segmentation of the cerebral structures can be performed in the same time. [Code and Paper](https://github.com/andachamamci/CATractography) <br> In the **IronTract Challenge**, the accuracy was evaluated by comparison to tracer injections in the same macaque brains as the diffusion data. The accuracy of the proposed method (5th method) was between the deterministic and probabilistic methods.
