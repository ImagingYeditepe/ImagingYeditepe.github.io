## Research

#### Diffusion MR Fiber Tractography

|**Cellular Automata Tractography** method, which runs on GPU, allows shortest-paths tractography under one second runtime. Furthermore, connectivity based segmentation of the cerebral structures can be performed at the same time, as shown in the figure. [Code and Paper](https://github.com/andachamamci/CATractography) <br> In the **IronTract Challenge**, the accuracy was evaluated by comparison to tracer injections in the same macaque brains as the diffusion data. The accuracy of the proposed method (5th method) was between the deterministic and probabilistic methods.

#### Functional MRI Applications

**EFFECTS OF MENSTRUAL CYCLE ON RESTING STATE FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY IN SCHIZOPHRENIA** <br> The present study investigates resting state functional connectivity (RS-FC) alterations related to menstrual cycle phase and/or hormone levels in patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls and aims to contribute to the understanding of the effects of ovarian hormones on the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and brain functions.
