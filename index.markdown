<h2>About</h2>
<strong>Biomedical Engineering Our laboratory</strong>  is mostly used for projects that require high processing power, such as 3D modeling of medical images or running artificial learning algorithms. The computers here are also configured for this purpose. (21 ‚ÄùFull HD Monitor, Intel Xeon processor, 32gb RAM, SSD disk, GTX 1080Ti graphics card)
Additionaly, most of the electronic equipment needed in some projects are also in the laboratory. (Linear Current source, multimeter, soldering machine, ... etc)
Projects carried out within the scope of the imaging laboratory are mostly aimed at solving a real-life problem using image processing techniques through programming.
